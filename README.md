D4X is an 8-bit computer emulator with a 64KB memory space. The system uses 16-bit addresses and supports basic instructions for arithmetic, logic, and control flow operations.

The computer is designed to provide a simple environment for testing and emulating low-level programs. It includes a basic instruction set for performing operations like addition, subtraction, comparison, jumps, and data movement. The memory is fully addressable with 16-bit instructions.

Currently, the assembler/compiler for D4X is not yet completed, so you will need to write machine code directly or use a custom tool to convert assembly code to machine code.

The program is built in C and can be compiled using a standard C compiler. The emulator simulates the execution of machine code on the D4X CPU.

The system is simple and designed for educational purposes, providing insight into the workings of an 8-bit CPU and its basic instruction set.
